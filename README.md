# Slack Good Morning App
A basic node cli script to say good morning to configured Slack workspaces.

DO NOT CHECK IN YOUR SLACK TOKENS OR WORKSPACE NAMES

# Install
As it is a node app, don't forget to `npm install` in the root directory.

The app will need an Oauth access token. That means installing the `slack-good-morning-app` to a workspace and giving it `chat:write:user` permission to speak on the logged in user's behalf.

Add that token to a created `config/default.js` file with structure `{ slack: { token } }`.
